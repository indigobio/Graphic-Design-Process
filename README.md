# Graphic-Design-Process

## **1. The Brief**

**There are two main categories of graphic design: UI design and branding & marketing materials.** 

**UI design:**

**To learn how users use Ax and how they feel about it. To this end, I would perform a semi-structured interview.** **For the structured portion of the interview, I would like to ask the following questions:** 

- **What gives them a sense of quality in products like this?**  

- **What helps them to trust something they are seeing?**  

- **What do they fear?**  

- **What do other items look like in this context, and how can we stand out?** 

**Other questions would be like: Why, when, and where do users use this product? What do users like or dislike about it? What would users change about it if they can? etc.**

**If it is a UI design project, it would be great to observe how you would use the interface. I would like to see you perform the task that needs to be addressed or interact with the function that needs to be redesigned. This would really help me understand the scenario of the user's behavior.**

**After data collecting, many other data analysis tools could help us understand our target users more, and there are also many benefits of using these tools: making sure that everyone is on the same page during a project, fast training new project members, fast landing new features without checking all the information again, etc.**

**I've put all these tools here. There are personas, user scenarios, and journey maps.** 

**In addition to understanding the user, there are other questions I would like to know about this project:**

- **Deliverable expectations and scope of the design: ex: "change x about this starting piece" vs. a try several options.**
- **Timeline expectations and milestones**

**Branding & Marketing materials:**

At the beginning of the project, I'd like to know the following information:

About user:

- Target audience
- What you intend viewers to do when they see the final product (call to action)

About the final product:

- What the final product should be (I.e., brochure, banner, etc.)
- Timeline expectations and milestones

Other information:

- Previous Version (if any)
- Deliverable platform (journal, conference, website, etc.)

## 2. Market Research

**For market research, there are three different dimensions of competitors I would like to analyze:**

- **Aesthetics: Who has the trending design of a similar interface or product?**
- **Functional: Who has the most robust method of a similar interface or product?**
- **Industrial: Who standing on the top of the industrial shares a similar interface or product?**

**The purpose of doing this is to understand our possibilities and limitations. The best solution would be the combination of the advantages of the competitors in three dimensions. If necessary, we can dig into one of the companies that interest you the most. I would like to use the SWOT analysis to understand the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. As well as the brand analysis to acknowledge the current market niche and shape our direction. Serious vs. Fun.  Simple vs. Complex.  Bright vs. Dark.  What feeling do they hope the audience experiences when interacting with the result? We would like the final deliverable to be consistent with our brand identification and fulfill the client's requirements.**

**You can find the example of SWOT and brand analysis here.** 

## **3. Moodboarding**

**Based on our discussion before, I'd provide two to three different design solutions in a Google slide and explain how and why I choose this direction. And it is also a good time to share any reference information or other resources that you've found and would like to go for this way.** 

## **4. Brainstorming**

**Based on the type of task being requested, I'd provide a menu of options here. There would be no strict order of when should we perform brainstorming. We can share your ideas anytime when we have the inspiration. What we need to do is always keep an open mind for any possibilities!** 

## **5. Thumbnailing**

**To make sure I understand everything right so far, I'd summarize what I've heard in this step. It's also helpful that we could confirm everyone is on the same page. The deliverable here would be a Google slide, including a sketch drawing for the idea or reference images for future design direction.** 

## **6. Concept Development**

**If it is a UI design project, I'd like to provide a low fidelity prototype, which is a wireframe interface design that loses its scale, color, and all the details. Based on your requirement, I could make this prototype interactive, which is a fast tool to conduct quick testing among the stakeholders or even to potential users. The deliverable here would be a Balsamiq link for you to interact and leave comments.**

## **7. Visual Exploration**

**If it is a UI design project, I'd like to share a high fidelity prototype, which would look just like a real website. You can interact with it and let me know how do you think about the overall experience. Please focus on not only the visual design but also the interactive design since both are essentially important. The deliverable here would be a Figma link for you to interact and leave comments.**

## **8. Concept Refinement**

**The iteration of the design would take time. If it is a UI design project and you don't know how to give feedback, here is a usability evaluation that needs to be performed by a product expert like you, called heuristic evaluation:**

**I've put the template of heuristic evaluation canvas here for your reference.**

## **9. Client Feedback**

**If it is a UI design project, we can conduct usability testing for the interactive prototype design we have here.** **I'm willing to conduct more research to evaluate my design. Interviewing and observation would be the two most standard tools, but others like thinking aloud, SUS, focus groups are also beneficial. I'll write the protocol for each of them for you to use in the future.** 

## **10. Revisions**

I'd try to fix all the feedback I've got. I'd provide the updated version at our weekly/daily meeting. If you would like to see the revisions earlier, please let me know. I could share the updated files the day before the meeting.

## **11. Client Approval**

I'd consider it's an approval when every stakeholder has no feedback and is happy with the revision. If the timeline is flexible, then it's fine to keep iterating.

## **12. Final Delivery**

After client approval, I'll work on the details and make sure everything is right. Please let me know the format of the final deliverable. (Ex, .png .pdf .ai...etc)

## **13. Production**

I'd keep working with developers after the design process. I'll keep my eyes on it if the design document needs to be managed or tracked in a designated format.
