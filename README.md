# Graphic-Design-Process

## **1. The Brief**

At the beginning of the project, I'd like to know the following information:

About user:

- Target audience
- What you intend viewers to do when they see the final product (call to action)

About the final product:

- What the final product should be (I.e., brochure, banner, etc.)
- Timeline expectations and milestones

Other information:

- Previous Version (if any)
- Deliverable platform (journal, conference, website, etc.)

## 2. Market Research

After the initial information reviewing, I'll conduct market research. I'll show how the competitors in our industry do for your reference. Sometimes I'd like to see how the lead companies in our industry do. The purpose of doing this is for the next two steps: moodboarding and brainstorming. I'd like to get feedback about:

- Examples of market research you like (and don't)
- Why

## **3. Moodboarding**

In this step, I would like to hear your idea first since you are the one who is really understanding our target audience. Otherwise, I'd provide my ideas for moodboarding based on market research. I would need to know your feedback about:

- Examples you like (and don't)
- Why

## **4. Brainstorming**(not necessary)

Upon this stage, you can let me know all the possibilities that you have ever been thinking in your mind regardless of the timeline, budget, platform, etc. We would focus on how to fulfill our goal and make users satisfied. 

## **5. Thumbnailing**(not necessary)

For most of the time, I'd skip this stage and jump to concept development unless I encountered a bottleneck.

## **6. Concept Development**

Now it's time to converge to one or two concepts. I'd include at least one deliverable for each concept. 

## **7. Visual Exploration**

For each concept, I'd show at least one visual exploration since most of the time it's good to have choices. You can ask for more options if you can't decide which one is better.

## **8. Concept Refinement**

Sometimes, if you can not make a decision, maybe the problem is not about visual exploration. If this happened, I'd go back to moodboarding to make sure I'm on the right track.

## **9. Client Feedback**

Feedback would go back and forth among stakeholders during client feedback steps, and sometimes we have to change every decision we have made and restart. It's super normal to have this happened, so don't be hesitate to let me know if anything needs to be changed during this step.

## **10. Revisions**

I'd try to fix all the feedback I've got. I'd provide the updated version at our weekly/daily meeting. If you would like to see the revisions earlier, please let me know. I could share the updated files the day before the meeting.

## **11. Client Approval**

I'd consider it's an approval when every stakeholder has no feedback and is happy with the revision. If the timeline is flexible, then it's fine to keep iterating.

## **12. Final Delivery**

After client approval, I'll work on the details and make sure everything is right. Please let me know the format of the final deliverable. (Ex, .png .pdf .ai...etc)

## **13. Production**

I'd keep working with developers after the design process. I'll keep my eyes on it if the design document needs to be managed or tracked in a designated format.
